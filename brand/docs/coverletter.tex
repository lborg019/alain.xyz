\section*{To InVision,}

Your \textbf{Senior Graphics Engineer} position sounds very interesting for someone with my skills and background. We should talk! I'm Currently a recently admitted computer graphics PhD candidate and researcher for Florida International University and have been focusing on computer graphics throughout my undergraduate degree and on my personal time, I'm very passionate about it!

\vspace{-1.3em}

\section*{Publications}

I've recently been contracted by \textbf{Packt Publishing} to produce a book on Vulkan, titled \textit{Vulkan by Example}.

I've published 3 papers in the areas of computer graphics and human computer interaction. A relevant paper your team might be interested in is my 3DUI 2017 paper on \href{https://alain.xyz/research/realtime-celestial-rendering}{\textbf{Realtime Celestial Rendering for 3D Naviation Environments}}. 

I'm currently working towards a visual programming app called \href{https://github.com/OpenHID/code-vr}{\textbf{CodeVR}}, which was featured on the Voices of VR podcast. It maps python Code to a 3D environment, allowing users to explore codebases in virtual reality. It's powered by a custom rendering engine written in Rust that uses the Vulkan API.


\section*{Experience}

I've been an employee for the OpenHID Research Lab, a Human Computer Interaction and hardware design lab part of the High Performance Database Research Center, a laboratory that focuses on mapping systems. Prior I was a game developer/software engineer at FIU's enterprise web services, working on a gamification project.

\subsection*{Open Source}

Your team would be interested in my \href{https://github.com/hyperfuse/coronal}{\textbf{Coronal library}}, an open source declarative WebGL rendering library built around the Khronos Group's GLTF specification. In addition, my library \href{https://github.com/hyperfuse/react-anime}{\textbf{React Anime}} is quite interesting, it provides a simple declarative method of rendering animations with React.js. 


\subsection*{Volunteering}

I'm also a volunteer musician for The Princeton Church of Homestead, as well as a speaker for the Miami Game Developer Meetup,
