# Accelerated Unity

Unity is a popular multiplatform game engine. Developers create **Scenes** composed of **GameObjects**, which are in turn composed of **Components** which are responsible for handling logic, physics, rendering, etc. 

## File Hierarchy

Most projects in Unity organizes files by *Type*.

```bash
├─ Assets/
│   ├─ Scenes
│   ├─ Materials
│   ├─ Models
│   ├─ Prefabs
│   ├─ Scripts
│   └─ ...
├─ ProjectSettings/
│   └─ ...
└─ readme.md
```
