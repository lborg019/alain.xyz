\noindent \textit{I'm a graduate research assistant for \acr{FIU}'s OpenHID Lab, a \acr{HCI} lab part of the High Performance Database Research Center, where my research focuses on low level graphics programming, in addition to solving graphics related problems for other researchers in the lab. \\ I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science with a focus in Computer Graphics Software Architecture.} \\

My research was featured in \acr{IEEE 3DUI} 2017, I've won a number of Hackathons including HackStetson (First), UHack (Third), and have been featured on Codepen, Newgrounds, and PixelJoint for my Open Source work and Personal Projects. I volunteer as a guitarist for Princeton Church of Homestead, as well as a speaker for \acr{FIU} and the Miami Game Developer Meetup.
