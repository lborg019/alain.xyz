The following are notes on Vulkan, the new graphics API by Khronos.

Vulkan is a low level API that offers explicit control over every aspect of allocation, memory management, and execution of graphics.

```cpp
#include <obsidian.h>

//so many possible constructs, what to do.

// Design it around building growing structures.
// It could be designed around the idea of paralell processing of instances that feature a render function.
// Or it could be built
```

## Program Execution

A Vulkan program executes as follows:

1. **Load the Library** - Your application loads the Vulkan library provided by your graphics card driver. This can be handled by the *Vulkan SDK's Loading Layer*, or by using system specific calls like Win32's `LoadLibrary("C:/Windows/SysWOW64/vulkan-1-1-0-30-0.dll")`.

2. **Get the Library Functions** - Reference a `vulkan.h` file, which is a part of the SDK, or you can generate  from their [API documentation repo](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs)).

1. **Create your Vulkan App** - with `vkInstance instance;` [RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization) comes into play here.

2. **Query for Devices** - you can send request to check what devices are on this computer with `vkPhysicalDevices`. Then you can allocate data structures and tasks independently. Since you have semephoric support of the app, concurrent rendering is possible!

3. **Initialize Device Queue** - Create a `vkDevice`, specify it's features with `vkPhysicalDeviceFeatures`, and create `vkQueue`(s) to handle requests. (Just like OpenCL).

4. **Create a Window Surface** - `vkSurfaceKHR` (like a canvas in WebGL), and a swap chain `vkSwapChainKHR` (Basically frames to be rendered for double/tripple buffering.)

5. **Set up your Render Passes** with `vkFrameBuffer`.

6. **Create a pipeline** with `vkPipeline`. SPecify the current shader with `vkShaderModule` objects. This is perfect for deffered rendering techniques.

7. **Send draw operations** to the `vkQueue` in groups called `vkCommandBuffer`(s). Each Queue is allocated from a `vkCommandPool`

8. **Manage the changing of frames** via `vkAcuqireNextImageKHR`, execute the command buffers you're rendering with `vkQueueSubmit`, and display the image with `vkQueuePresentKHR`.

## Example Frame function calls.

```
|- Debug Frame
  |- Frame Start
  |- Color Pass #1 (1 Targets)
      |- 7) vkCmdPipelineBarrier
      |- 8) vkCmdBeginRenderPass
      |- 9) vkCmdBindPipeline
      |- 10) vkCmdBindDescriptorSet
      |- 11) vkCmdSetViewport
      |- 12) vkCmdSetScissor
      |- 13) vkCmdDraw(36, 1)
      |- 14) vkCmdEndRenderPass(C = Store, D=Don't Care)
      |- 17) vkQueueSubmit(1)[0] vkBeginCommandBuffer(ID 172)
      |- 18) vkQueuePresentKHR()
```
