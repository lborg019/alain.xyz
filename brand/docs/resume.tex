\begin{multicols}{2}
\noindent \textit{I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. Student with a focus in Computer Graphics, Author of the upcoming Vulkan by Example course by Packt Publishing, and Researcher for Florida International University's Open Human Interaction Design (\acr{OpenHID}) Lab, a lab that focuses on Human Computer Interaction, Computer Graphics, and Hardware Design.} \\

I've published papers to \acr{IEEE 3DUI} 2017 and \acr{IEEE VR 2017}, I've won hackathons in universities such as Stetson, University of Miami, and have been featured on the Voices of VR and Codepen for my open source work. I volunteer as a speaker for the Miami Game Dev Meetup and as a guitarist for Princeton Church.
