At IEEE VR 2017 I had the pleasure of talking with Run Yu, Masters student at Virginia Tech, who introduced me to [Kayvon Fatahalian](https://twitter.com/kayvonf)'s [Visual Computing Systems](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15769/fall2016/home) course. The course covered everything:

1. Research History
2. Cameras
3. Compression
4. Neural Networks
5. 3D Reconstruction
6. Realtime Rendering
7. Physical Simulations
8. Machine Learning

This course is an attempt at continuing Kayvon's work, by updating it with some of the latest research in Virtual Reality and Human Computer Interaction, as well as making the course online and interactive.
